I was on a hike with friends, and I was explaining how much happier my spouse had become recently after starting a band with some friends.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just nice for them, I think, to have this creative outlet that\u2019s not their job,\u201d I told my friends. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be something that brings them money, just something that lets them unwind and have fun.\u201d\n\nMy friends reminded me there was a word for that.\n\nFor many of us, expectations of an \u201calways-on\u201d working life have made hobbies a thing of the past, relegated to mere memories of what we used to do in our free time. Worse still, many hobbies have morphed into the dreaded side hustle or as paths to career development, turning the things we ostensibly do for fun into \u2026 more work. (\u201cLike embroidery? You should be selling your creations on Etsy!\u201d).\n\nBut it\u2019s time to divest hobbies from productivity. Their value lies in more than their relationship to work. Yes, studies have shown that having a hobby can make you more productive at work, but hobbies can also remind you that work isn\u2019t everything.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it telling that you forgot?\u201d said Brigid Schulte, author of \u201cOverwhelmed: Work, Love and Play When No One Has the Time,\u201d when I told her I had blanked on the word.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s so indicative of where we are in our culture right now, that you can actually forget what it is to have something you like to do that\u2019s not a) tied to work and b) productive,\u201d Ms. Schulte said.\n\nWhile researching her book Ms. Schulte realized how many \u201clifehacks\u201d make hobbies out to be keys to productivity rather than activities just meant to be enjoyed, and she saw that it was difficult for people to get out of that way of thinking.\n\nBut eventually, she found that people responded to \u201cneuroscience and research about how you need a space where you\u2019re calm that leads to insight.\u201d Yet even with that knowledge in hand, Ms. Schulte said, people still saw hobbies as means to improve their performance at work. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way I can break through to people about why having leisure is important.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Americans\u2019 difficult relationship with leisure is nothing new.\n\n\u201cPeople forget that when we were negotiating the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938, there were three conditions people wanted: minimum wage, 40-hour workweek and mandatory two-week vacation,\u201d Ms. Schulte said. We got two out of three, \u201cand we\u2019ve been stuck ever since.\u201d One in four Americans has no access to paid time off, and those who do often don\u2019t take all of their vacation time or they spend their vacations checking email. Many of us have been taught to hate not being productive, and we\u2019ve structured our culture around work, not play.\n\nBy Jaya Saxena\nThe New York Times", "image": "056d1b5f5d4d4651b88a9478df0a1cfa_hobbies-news2.jpg", "image_caption": "", "topic": "10", "created_at": "Mon, 01 Jun 2020 22:15:28 -0000", "updated_at": null, "published": false, "popular": false, "top_article": false, "editors_pick": false, "user": {"id": 2, "full_name": "M.

They drive engagement, but platforms that hope to retain top creators must help them do one thing well: make money. Influencing is a career, after all, and if creators aren\u2019t getting paid, they will eventually stop showing up for work.\n\nUntil now, Instagram has taken a relatively hands-off role in monetization. Influencers are free to negotiate their own brand deals, provided they don\u2019t violate the platform\u2019s terms of service.\n\nBut Instagram doesn\u2019t pay creators directly or give them a percentage of sales achieved through the platform\u2019s shopping feature, for instance. Influencers generally receive checks from brands that team up with them, rather than from Instagram, which hosts their content.\n\nAccording to a February report in Digiday, some influencers have been skeptical about Instagram\u2019s IGTV feature, which they think bears too many similarities to YouTube and TikTok, without the benefits of those platforms.\n\nOn YouTube, creators can run ads on videos and receive monthly payments from the platform. And on TikTok, livestreaming creators can earn thousands of dollars in digital gifts. Instagram influencers have consequently pursued audiences on other platforms where their revenue streams may be more stable.\n\nWith its new monetization features, Instagram hopes to convince creators that its platform can support their work both functionally and financially. Ads from brands including Sephora, Ikea, Puma and other test partners will begin appearing in IGTV videos next week, with 55 percent of the ad revenue going to the creator (a cut that\u2019s comparable to YouTube).\n\n\u201cCreators already put an incredible amount of effort into their content, and it\u2019s crucial that they can make money from that content in order to fuel their work in the future,\u201d said Justin Osofsky, the chief operating officer of Instagram.\n\nWith the introduction of badges, creators will be able to make money through Instagram Live, which has seen more engagement since widespread stay-at-home orders were put in place (the company reported a 70 percent increase in views from February to March).\n\nThe badges will appear as little hearts next to a user\u2019s comments on a livestream and will cost 99 cents to $4.99. For now, creators will receive 100 percent of the money made from badges, though Instagram could roll out a revenue-sharing agreement after the test phase is over, likely in 2021.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all approach to monetization, so we\u2019re focused on building a suite of tools that can support the different needs and ambitions of creators in the long term,\u201d Mr. Osofsky wrote in an email.\n\nOver the last two years, influencers have sought more direct forms of monetization, primarily through merchandise sales; the expansion of Instagram\u2019s shopping features is aimed at addressing that revenue stream. And while brand deals will also be easier to find with the expansion of Instagram\u2019s Brand Collab Manager, those agreements will likely become more complex.\n\nThe New York Times \nBy Taylor Lorenz", "image": "cd634b01633e4bfea6eb05c3ff9a716a_business-news1.jpg", "image_caption": "charleeatkins on instagram", "topic": "4", "created_at": "Wed, 27 May 2020 22:55:47 -0000", "updated_at": "Thu, 28 May 2020 12:38:52 -0000", "published": true, "popular": true, "top_article": false, "editors_pick": false, "user": {"id": 3, "full_name": "Linda Agustine", "email": "linda@gmail.com", "password": "55684f0c16942d185ed64f96d3fcc367cc2e78378aaee093e1f319c02de02f45651c714239e3b386ede778111b4ad8cf0b92945f65dae6d77b0a29d4d8bf5458", "avatar": "53c39b5a398d4f059aba702c73b348f8_avatar-linda.jpg", "bio": "", "status": true}}, {"id": 4, "user_id": 2, "title": "The Diabetes Diet", "text": "People with diabetes have nearly double the risk of heart disease and are at a greater risk of developing mental health disorders such as depression. But most cases of type 2 diabetes are preventable and some can even be reversed. Taking steps to prevent or control diabetes doesn\u2019t mean living in deprivation; it means eating a tasty, balanced diet that will also boost your energy and improve your mood. You don\u2019t have to give up sweets entirely or resign yourself to a lifetime of bland food.\n\nWhether you\u2019re trying to prevent or control diabetes, your nutritional needs are virtually the same as everyone else, so no special foods are necessary. But you do need to pay attention to some of your food choices\u2014most notably the carbohydrates you eat. While following a Mediterranean or other heart-healthy diet can help with this, the most important thing you can do is to lose a little weight.\n\nLosing just 5% to 10% of your total weight can help you lower your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. Losing weight and eating healthier can also have a profound effect on your mood, energy, and sense of wellbeing. Even if you\u2019ve already developed diabetes, it\u2019s not too late to make a positive change. By eating healthier, being more physically active, and losing weight, you can reduce your symptoms or even reverse diabetes. The bottom line is that you have more control over your health than you may think.\n\nThe biggest risk for diabetes: belly fat\nBeing overweight or obese is the biggest risk factor for type 2 diabetes. However, your risk is higher if you tend to carry your weight around your abdomen as opposed to your hips and thighs. A lot of belly fat surrounds the abdominal organs and liver and is closely linked to insulin resistance. You are at an increased risk of developing diabetes if you are:\n- A woman with a waist circumference of 35 inches or more\n- A man with a waist circumference of 40 inches or more\n\nCalories obtained from fructose (found in sugary beverages such as soda, energy and sports drinks, coffee drinks, and processed foods like doughnuts, muffins, cereal, candy and granola bars) are more likely to add weight around your abdomen. Cutting back on sugary foods can mean a slimmer waistline as well as a lower risk of diabetes.", "image": "8f78a001659b4cb6a094f26781e2524c_health-news1.jpg", "image_caption": "Healthy eating", "topic": "4", "created_at": "Wed, 27 May 2020 22:44:49 -0000", "updated_at": "Wed, 27 May 2020 22:46:23 -0000", "published": true, "popular": true, "top_article": false, "editors_pick": false, "user": {"id": 2, "full_name": "M.

These include white bread, pizza dough, pasta, pastries, white flour, white rice, sweet desserts, and many breakfast cereals. They digest quickly and their high glycemic index causes unhealthy spikes in blood sugar levels. They can also cause fluctuations in mood and energy and a build-up of fat, especially around your waistline.\n\nWhen you eat refined carbs, your bloodstream is flooded with sugar which triggers a surge of insulin to clear the sugar from your blood. All this insulin can leave you feeling hungry soon after a meal, often craving more sugary carbs. This can cause you to overeat, put on weight, and over time lead to insulin resistance and type-2 diabetes. Diets high in refined carbs and sugar have also been linked to high blood pressure, heart disease, obesity, hyperactivity, mood disorders, and even suicide in teenagers.\n\nFor many of us, cutting back on sugary treats and overcoming our carb cravings can seem like a daunting task. As well as being present in obvious foods such as sugary snacks, desserts, and candies, sugar is also hidden in much of the processed food we eat\u2014from soda, coffee and fruit drinks to bread, pasta sauce, and frozen dinners. But cutting back on these diet saboteurs doesn\u2019t mean feeling unsatisfied or never enjoying comfort food again. The key is to choose the right carbs. Complex carbs such as vegetables, whole grains, and naturally sweet fruit digest slower, resulting in stable blood sugar and less fat accumulation.\n\nBy focusing on whole foods and complex, unrefined carbs, you can reduce your intake of sugar and refined carbs, keep your blood sugar stable, maintain a healthy weight, and still find ways to satisfy your sweet tooth. You\u2019ll not only feel healthier and more energetic, you could also shed that stubborn belly fat so many of us struggle with.\n\nGood carbs vs. bad carbs\n\nCarbohydrates are one of your body\u2019s main sources of energy. Health organizations such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommend that 45 to 65 percent of your daily calories should come from carbohydrates. However, the majority of these should be from complex, unrefined carbs rather than refined carbs (including starches such as potatoes and corn).\n\nUnlike simple carbs, complex carbohydrates are digested slowly, causing a gradual rise in blood sugar. They\u2019re usually high in nutrients and fiber, which can help prevent serious disease, aid with weight-loss, and improve your energy levels. In general, \u201cgood\u201d carbohydrates have a lower glycemic load and can even help guard against type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular problems in the future.\n\nGood carbs include:\n\nUnrefined whole grains \u2013 whole wheat or multigrain bread, brown rice, barley, quinoa, bran cereal, oatmeal\n\nNon-starchy vegetables \u2013 spinach, green beans, Brussels sprouts, celery, tomatoes\n\nLegumes \u2013 kidney beans, baked beans, peas, lentils\n\nNuts \u2013 peanuts, cashews, walnuts\n\nFruit \u2013 apples, berries, citrus fruit, bananas, pears\n\n\nSwitching to good carbs\n\nWhile there are many health benefits to switching from refined to complex carbs, you don\u2019t have to consign yourself to never again eating French fries or a slice of white bread. After all, when you ban certain foods, it\u2019s natural to crave those foods even more. Instead, make refined carbs and sugary foods an occasional indulgence rather than a regular part of your diet. As you reduce your intake of these unhealthy foods, you\u2019ll likely find yourself craving them less and less.", "image": "530f490a3e894af4950e75bbb360ad52_food-news2.jpg", "image_caption": "Carbs and sugar", "topic": "6", "created_at": "Wed, 27 May 2020 18:21:43 -0000", "updated_at": "Wed, 27 May 2020 22:39:11 -0000", "published": true, "popular": false, "top_article": false, "editors_pick": true, "user": {"id": 2, "full_name": "M.

At the end of a hectic day, eating out or ordering in might feel like the quickest, easiest option. But convenience food can take a significant toll on your mood and health.\n\nProcessed food is typically high in chemical additives, hormones, sugar, salt, unhealthy fat, and calories, all of which can adversely affect your brain and outlook. It can leave you feeling tired, bloated, and irritable, and exacerbate symptoms of depression, stress, anxiety, and other mental health concerns. It can also affect your waistline. A recent study showed that people who eat out consume an average of 200 more calories a day than those who prepare meals at home.\n\nBy cooking for yourself, you can ensure that you and your family eat fresh, wholesome meals. This can help you to look and feel healthier, boost your energy, stabilize your weight and mood, and improve your sleep and resilience to stress. When you prepare your own food, you\u2019re also more aware of exactly what you\u2019re putting in your body, and how different foods affect the way you think and feel.\n\nCooking at home doesn\u2019t have to be complicated. The cornerstone of a healthy diet is to eat food that is as close as possible to the way nature made it. That means replacing processed food with real food whenever possible and eating plenty of vegetables and healthy sources of protein. It doesn\u2019t mean you have to spend hours in the kitchen combining hundreds of different ingredients or slavishly following elaborate recipes. In fact, simple meals are often the tastiest. And you don\u2019t have to be perfect and make every meal at home, either. Cooking at home just a few times a week can reap rewards.\n\nCooking at home is also a great way to spend time with others\u2014and you don\u2019t have to be an accomplished chef. Whatever your abilities or experience as a cook, you can learn to prepare quick and healthy meals that can have real benefits for your mental and physical health.", "image": "c78ce782c8c94fe9baac3cc41b26aebe_food-news1.jpg", "image_caption": "The benefits of cooking at home", "topic": "6", "created_at": "Wed, 27 May 2020 17:33:59 -0000", "updated_at": null, "published": true, "popular": true, "top_article": true, "editors_pick": true, "user": {"id": 2, "full_name": "M.
