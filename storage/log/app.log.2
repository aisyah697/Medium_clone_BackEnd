At the end of a hectic day, eating out or ordering in might feel like the quickest, easiest option. But convenience food can take a significant toll on your mood and health.\n\nProcessed food is typically high in chemical additives, hormones, sugar, salt, unhealthy fat, and calories, all of which can adversely affect your brain and outlook. It can leave you feeling tired, bloated, and irritable, and exacerbate symptoms of depression, stress, anxiety, and other mental health concerns. It can also affect your waistline. A recent study showed that people who eat out consume an average of 200 more calories a day than those who prepare meals at home.\n\nBy cooking for yourself, you can ensure that you and your family eat fresh, wholesome meals. This can help you to look and feel healthier, boost your energy, stabilize your weight and mood, and improve your sleep and resilience to stress. When you prepare your own food, you\u2019re also more aware of exactly what you\u2019re putting in your body, and how different foods affect the way you think and feel.\n\nCooking at home doesn\u2019t have to be complicated. The cornerstone of a healthy diet is to eat food that is as close as possible to the way nature made it. That means replacing processed food with real food whenever possible and eating plenty of vegetables and healthy sources of protein. It doesn\u2019t mean you have to spend hours in the kitchen combining hundreds of different ingredients or slavishly following elaborate recipes. In fact, simple meals are often the tastiest. And you don\u2019t have to be perfect and make every meal at home, either. Cooking at home just a few times a week can reap rewards.\n\nCooking at home is also a great way to spend time with others\u2014and you don\u2019t have to be an accomplished chef. Whatever your abilities or experience as a cook, you can learn to prepare quick and healthy meals that can have real benefits for your mental and physical health.", "image": "c78ce782c8c94fe9baac3cc41b26aebe_food-news1.jpg", "image_caption": "The benefits of cooking at home", "topic": "6", "created_at": "Wed, 27 May 2020 17:33:59 -0000", "updated_at": null, "published": true, "popular": true, "top_article": true, "editors_pick": true, "user": {"id": 2, "full_name": "M.
