It would become the most successful arcade game of all time.\n\nThe hero -- shaped like a mouth opening and closing -- races around a maze noisily gobbling dots and occasionally fruit for extra points, all the while avoiding four cunning ghosts named Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde.\n\nAs every Pac-Man player knows, the greatest joy comes from turning the tables by munching a power pellet, sending the ghosts fleeing in all directions as they suddenly become edible themselves.\n\nThe game was originally called Puck-Man (an onomatopoeic play on the Japanese word \"paku\", meaning to gobble) but it was changed when it launched in the United States for fear gamers would inevitably change the \"P\" to an \"F\".\n\nGame designer Toru Iwatani came up with the shape for the adorable hero when he took a small slice from a pizza and realized the remainder looked like a wide-open mouth.\n\nPac-Man was aimed at women and couples -- a different audience to the violent alien shoot-em-ups popular in Japanese arcades at the time, Iwatani explained in a 2010 interview with Wired magazine.\n\nThe first edition was placed in a cinema in the trendy Tokyo district of Shibuya rather than a male-dominated arcade to test the target audience, he said.\n\n\"The women and couples were very happy about the machine, very excited. They came up to it and put their hands on it, so we thought that our target concept had been very much in sync and correct,\" he said.\n\nHard-core gamers turned up their noses but \"it was for people who didn't play games on a daily basis -\u2013 women, children, the elderly\".\n\nThe idea of Pac-Man turning the tables on his spooky tormentors came from the cartoon series Popeye, where the nautical hero is only able to take on his nemesis Bluto after a healthy dose of spinach, Iwatani explained.\n\n'Tremendously monotonous'\n\nFrom these humble beginnings, Pac-Man would go on to be recognized by Guinness World Records as the most successful coin-operated arcade game of all time.\n\nIt has spawned several spin-offs, including \"Pac 'n Roll\", \"Ms. Pac-Man\", \"Pac-in-Time\" and \"Pac Panic\" -- a massive money spinner for creators Bandai Namco.\n\nThe firm claims the lovable character has a brand recognition of 90 percent around the world -- \"one of the most recognized on the planet\".\n\nTo celebrate the game's 30th birthday, Google unveiled its first-ever playable \"Doodle\" and the internet giant also rolled out a version of the game for its Maps service -- turning the real streets of a city into a labyrinth to gobble up pellets and ghosts.\n\nAccording to Wired, the \"perfect score\" is 3,333,360 points -- possible only by getting to the final level 256 without losing a life and eating every dot, fruit and ghost possible.\n\n\"It was tremendously monotonous,\" Wired quoted the first record-holder, Billy Mitchell, as saying.\n\nPac-Man's 40th was celebrated with a special Twitter hashtag in Japan, with fans all over the country wishing their hero a happy birthday.\n\n\"The characters are colourful and cute. It was so fun. I remember I played a lot at my relative's house. Happy birthday Pac-Man!\" said one.\n\nthejakartapost.com", "image": "9a139c23c6734b09b83396e137fca480_hobbies-news1.jpg", "image_caption": "Healthy eating", "topic": "1", "created_at": "Mon, 01 Jun 2020 20:18:12 -0000", "updated_at": null, "published": true, "popular": true, "top_article": true, "editors_pick": true, "user": {"id": 1, "full_name": "Aisyah Putri Utami", "email": "aisyah@gmail.com", "password": "b24c67c3694a219b254ff73557533132a4114cb273618177a6c5b9e59205efa17d7be04762600ef25442191439bfa2c324340c36c7fce13ca679d5c4073e0206", "avatar": "402927a952a44a738a63277f20d55f59_avatar-aisyah.jpg", "bio": "", "status": true}}, {"id": 2, "user_id": 2, "title": "Cooking at Home", "text": "Whether you live on your own or are a busy parent, finding the time and energy to prepare home-cooked meals can seem like a daunting task. At the end of a hectic day, eating out or ordering in might feel like the quickest, easiest option. But convenience food can take a significant toll on your mood and health.\n\nProcessed food is typically high in chemical additives, hormones, sugar, salt, unhealthy fat, and calories, all of which can adversely affect your brain and outlook. It can leave you feeling tired, bloated, and irritable, and exacerbate symptoms of depression, stress, anxiety, and other mental health concerns. It can also affect your waistline. A recent study showed that people who eat out consume an average of 200 more calories a day than those who prepare meals at home.\n\nBy cooking for yourself, you can ensure that you and your family eat fresh, wholesome meals. This can help you to look and feel healthier, boost your energy, stabilize your weight and mood, and improve your sleep and resilience to stress. When you prepare your own food, you\u2019re also more aware of exactly what you\u2019re putting in your body, and how different foods affect the way you think and feel.\n\nCooking at home doesn\u2019t have to be complicated. The cornerstone of a healthy diet is to eat food that is as close as possible to the way nature made it. That means replacing processed food with real food whenever possible and eating plenty of vegetables and healthy sources of protein. It doesn\u2019t mean you have to spend hours in the kitchen combining hundreds of different ingredients or slavishly following elaborate recipes. In fact, simple meals are often the tastiest. And you don\u2019t have to be perfect and make every meal at home, either. Cooking at home just a few times a week can reap rewards.\n\nCooking at home is also a great way to spend time with others\u2014and you don\u2019t have to be an accomplished chef. Whatever your abilities or experience as a cook, you can learn to prepare quick and healthy meals that can have real benefits for your mental and physical health.", "image": "c78ce782c8c94fe9baac3cc41b26aebe_food-news1.jpg", "image_caption": "The benefits of cooking at home", "topic": "6", "created_at": "Wed, 27 May 2020 17:33:59 -0000", "updated_at": null, "published": true, "popular": true, "top_article": true, "editors_pick": true, "user": {"id": 2, "full_name": "M.
